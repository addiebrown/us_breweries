### Addison Brown, Ivan Aguirre, Jessica Jordan

### Dataset:  
-	API Database - https://brewerydb.com/developers/docs
-	Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/brkurzawa/us-breweries
-	Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/stansilas/mapping-brewery-pubs-across-us-states/data
-	Open Beer Database - https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/open-beer-database%40public-us/map/?refine.country=United+States&location=4,38.41056,-91.40625&basemap=jawg.sunny

### Overview:  
We will utilize data visualization to showcase breweries and to tell the story of how people unwind after a long day’s work. We will be displaying this data by using API’s, Datasets from Kaggle, JavaScript libraries (Leaflet, Plotly), PgAdmin PostGres, as well using VS studio code. Our main concern when we show our data will be showing the breweries in the U.S. as well as showing the name of brewery, type of beer (lager, port, etc.), category of beer (Irish ale, German lager, etc.), and location (city and state).
